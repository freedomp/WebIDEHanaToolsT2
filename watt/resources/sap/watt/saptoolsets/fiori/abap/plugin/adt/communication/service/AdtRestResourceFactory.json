If a precondition check fails, e.g. in case of illegal arguments, then an exception is thrown: one error object {message, stack}. Remark: The ABAP server requires a CSRF-token for state-changing requests (PUT, POST, DELETE). The token is retrieved by a separate request from ABAP server and cached in the AdtRestResource. Therefore the caller should use the same AdtRestResource for all requests to the same server, so that double internal requests for retrieving the CSRF-token from this server are avoided. Remark - Security checks: The created AdtRestResource instance performs security checks for input validation. There are mandatory security checks which result in an error. Not printable characters must not be contained in the request headers in the settings object. Username and password must be neither contained in the URL nor in the settings object. This also includes the query parameters 'sap-user' and 'sap-password'. Proprietary CSRF token handling is not allowed, because the CSRF token handling is done internally by the AdtRestResource. Optional security checks can be controlled via the 'security' property of the given settings object (see example below). The optional security checks can be executed in mode 'strict' (they throw an error) or 'info' (they write a warning into the console). The settings object must not contain the setting for a synchronous request. The protocol must be HTTPS.",
