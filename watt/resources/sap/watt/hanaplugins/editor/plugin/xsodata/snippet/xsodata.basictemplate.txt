// To define an XS OData service, you can use the following syntax.
// In the example below Aggregation, Modification and Association are defined.

service  { 

// Aggregation example: A view with ID Amount, Month, and Year columns created in {{package_path}} package.
// Call http://host:port/package/file.xsodata/MyView?$select=Year,Amount

   "{{package_path}}::my_view"             // Table or View  
   as "MyView"                             // Optional entity alias     
   with ( "ID","Year","Amount")            // Optional list of exposed columns
   key  ("ID")                             // Optional key relevant for view
   aggregates always (SUM of "Amount");    // Additional aggregation per column are MIN, MAX, AVG
        

// Modification exit example: A customer table and jsexit.xsjslib created in {{package_path}} package.
// Update and create are performed by jsexit.xsjslib functions instead of direct XSOData modifications,
// and delete is forbidden

   "{{package_path}}::customer" as "Customer"

                after "{{package_path}}:jsexit.xsjslib::update_after"   )  		// Alternatively use stored procedure 
   delete forbidden;

// Association example: Customer and order tables created in {{package_path}} package.
// Navigation from a customer to his orders is through the "Customer_Orders" association based on customer ID
// Call http://host:port/package/file.xsodata/Customers(<key>)/HisOrders
